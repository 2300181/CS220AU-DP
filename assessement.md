I find that my work is comprehensive and addresses the question effectively. I attempted to employ an academic writing style without making it too formal, in order for the reader to fully understands my thoughts despite the essay's length. I followed the other student’s feedback to incorporate more transitions between paragraphs for a smoother reading. I gradually progressed in my work to avoid delivering an average work due to a lack of time. I believe I managed my time well, as I succeeded in completing a first version before the holidays. In addressing my question, I tried to incorporate several concrete examples, although linking them to an existential risk was challenging. Nevertheless, I managed to find a reference, but I relied on my imagination for examples such as the social credit system in China to explain my reasoning and its connection to my question. I attempted to use illustrations to depict my content but opted for only three to maintain a seamless reading experience.

In my opinion, the essay provides a thorough exploration of the complexities of personal data use by governments, but also many relevant examples like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. I also liked the fact that she advised us to further explore the topic by watching documentary films such as The Great Hack. From a more general perspective, I think the essay follows a well-structured plan which makes it clear for us to understand. If I were to suggest improvements, I would maybe say that it could be worth making the writing a bit more concise and brief. I could also add that it would be nice to put a bit more transition phrases or words in between paragraphs for a better flow. Overall I thought it was a very interesting essay, not to mention easy to review as she kept progressing on it very regularly.
