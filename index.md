## Introduction
Nowadays, our increasing online engagement leads most individuals to expose some of their personal information to the world. Whether sharing with friends on social networks, inadvertently disclosing details through website cookies, or providing information to the government through documents like driver's licenses, people often engage in this information exchange without full awareness of the consequences that may follow. Although we are aware that the government exploits our data for a variety of purposes, it is interesting to explore the depth of how our personal data can actually be used by the government, well beyond what we might initially imagine. This research raises crucial questions about the limits of privacy in an increasingly connected world.  

## The Ambiguity of our Data Use

Personal data includes details such as a person's name, age or e-mail address, and can be used to identify an individual. Each country generally has its own legislation regulating data collection. As stated in the "The Conversation" article, most governments claim to use our personal data for research purposes, “leading to new knowledge about health, diseases and effective services to promote and support the development of individuals and communities”. Particularly in the context of the pandemic, where the use of personal data enabled many countries to map the spread of the virus.  

However, this practice can quickly become confusing. It is worth mentioning the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, where data collected without user consent was used to profile and target voters for the benefit of former US President Donald Trump during his victorious 2016 presidential campaign.  
The documentary film “The Great Hack” on Netflix analysed the scandal and has highlighted the potential dangers to democracy and human rights posed by unregulated data collection. 

It should be noted that this problem is not limited to a single company. States, such as China, can use companies for surveillance purposes, which may also endanger some rights.

## China & the Social Credit System
### What it consists
Officially announced in 2014, China's Social Credit System is a government-run system to monitor and evaluate the conduct of individuals and companies aimed at "creating a more harmonious and stable society by encouraging positive behaviour and discouraging negative behaviour" (HROne).  
This system consists of evaluating individuals by awarding points based on their behaviour. The credit points accumulated offer advantages, such as an easier access to credit or to employment. On the other hand, those with a low credit score may face sanctions, such as being refused access to certain services such as travel, education or healthcare.  
Data collection is the foundation of this system. Information is gathered from a variety of sources, including government agencies and social media platforms. These data are then used to assign a credit rating. To facilitate the rating process, the Chinese government plans to install more than 600 million surveillance cameras.

### The Problem
The Chinese government's data collection and constant surveillance create an oppressive atmosphere, strongly reminiscent of a dystopia. Individuals with poor credit can be deprived of certain fundamental rights, such as access to healthcare, constituting an abuse of government power. This system therefore discriminates people with poor credit.  
Concerns have been raised about the possibility of the government using this system to target and discriminate against individuals or groups based on their political beliefs or other personal characteristics. The possibility of denying access to healthcare to certain groups is deeply worrying. Given a situation where a person is between life and death and requires medical care, should they be condemned to death simply because of their poor credit? Is it possible that the government is seeking to eliminate those with poor credit in favour of a society made up exclusively of "honest citizens"?  

Even worse, it is legitimate to question whether the government could exploit this mass surveillance to identify and repress individuals who are not sufficiently loyal to the Communist Party, particularly with the omnipresence of hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras. This reality creates a climate of fear and propaganda. The ability to identify individuals easily, whether on social networks or in everyday life, makes it easier to convert certain people, as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated.  
According to the New York Times, "the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns on social medias doubled in the past two years". This highlights the scale of the problem and the need to think critically about the implications of data collection and government surveillance on society.  

## Where Can This Lead Us?
This is currently happening in China, where discrimination against a specific group is already apparent. Although the risk currently concerns a particular group, it could eventually spread to a wider group. Let's imagine that the Chinese government actually exploited this system to propagate its communist ideas. What if they decided to use social media to influence an even wider audience? Western governments are already expressing concern about the Chinese government's ability to access TikTok user data, a concern that has led the United States to ban the application from its soil.  

A more current example is Israel, which in 2016 launched the "Blue Wolf" technology. This captures images of Palestinians and then matches them with a database held by the Israeli army and intelligence services. Using facial recognition, the Israeli government can identify any individual of Palestinian origin. We are aware of the ongoing genocide in Palestine. Facial recognition could therefore potentially be used as a tool by the government to eliminate all Palestinians identified by surveillance cameras, thereby contributing to the eradication of this community.  

## Conclusion
The widespread use of personal data by governments for surveillance purposes raises major concerns about privacy, individual rights and the potential risks of abuse of power.  
Regulations must be introduced to regulate the way governments collect, store and use personal data. Without appropriate measures, mass surveillance can easily lead to dystopian scenarios where privacy becomes a relic of the past and political manipulation flourishes.

### Recommendations
As individuals, there are a number of things we can do to reduce its potential abuse: 
-	Be aware of the privacy policies of the online platforms we use
-	Favour security options such as two-factor authentication
-	Encourage the introduction of stricter regulations on the collection and use of data by governments
