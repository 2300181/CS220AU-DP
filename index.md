## Introduction
Nowadays, our increasing online engagement leads most individuals to expose some of their personal information to the world. Whether sharing with friends on social networks, inadvertently disclosing details through website cookies, or providing information to the government through documents like driver's licenses, people often engage in this information exchange without full awareness of the consequences that may follow. Although we are aware that the government exploits our data for a variety of purposes, it is interesting to explore the depth of how our personal data can actually be used by the government, well beyond what we might initially imagine. This research raises crucial questions about the limits of privacy in an increasingly connected world.  

## The Ambiguity of our Data Use

Personal data includes details such as a person's name, age or e-mail address, and can be used to identify an individual. Each country generally has its own legislation regulating data collection. According to an article from "The Conversation", most governments claim to use our personal data for research purposes, “leading to new knowledge about health, diseases and effective services to promote and support the development of individuals and communities”. Particularly in the context of the pandemic, where the use of personal data enabled many countries to map the spread of the virus. 

However, this practice can quickly become confusing. It is worth mentioning the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, where data collected without user consent was used to profile and target voters for the benefit of former US President Donald Trump during his victorious 2016 presidential campaign.  
The documentary film “The Great Hack” available on Netflix thoroughly analyses this scandal, shedding light on the potential dangers to democracy and human rights posed by unregulated data collection.  

It should be noted that this problem is not limited to a single company, but also governments, which use companies to obtain personal data. A good example is the US government, which collects personal data from its citizens. According to an article published in Sciences et Avenir, a French popular science magazine, many government agencies sign contracts with private companies to collect personal data. The article mentions collaborations such as between the Defence Intelligence Agency and LexisNexis, as well as agreements between the Navy and a company called Sayari Analytics. The US government's purchases reveal sensitive data on millions of people, such as private life, social class, and political opinions. This demonstrates that governments can use our personal data for purposes other than those often proclaimed to be "for our own good".  

However, our attention will shift to a specific country, China, which utilises companies for surveillance purposes, potentially compromising certain rights.

## China & the Social Credit System
### What it Consists
Officially announced in 2014, China's Social Credit System is a government-run system to monitor and evaluate the conduct of individuals and companies aimed at "creating a more harmonious and stable society by encouraging positive behaviour and discouraging negative behaviour" (HROne).    

This system consists of evaluating individuals by awarding points based on their behaviour. The credit points accumulated offer advantages, such as an easier access to credit or to employment. On the other hand, those with a low credit score may face sanctions, such as being refused access to certain services such as travel, education, or healthcare. The Chinese government's press agency, Global Times, recently stated that 11 million people had been prevented from flying and 4.5 million from taking the train.  

Data collection is the foundation of this system. Information is gathered from a variety of sources, including government agencies and social media platforms. These data are then used to assign a credit rating. To facilitate the rating process, the Chinese government plans to install more than 600 million surveillance cameras (RTS).  

Since 2014, China had only been experimenting with this project, but the experiment was considered conclusive: since 2020, it has been applied throughout the country, "subjecting 1.4 billion people to the world's first digital dictatorship" (Bon pour la tête).  

### An Abuse of Power
Also called "digital totalitarianism”, this system brings considerable consequences. The Chinese government's data collection and constant surveillance create an oppressive atmosphere, strongly reminiscent of a dystopia. Individuals with poor credit can be deprived of certain fundamental rights, such as access to healthcare, constituting an abuse of government power. This system therefore discriminates people with poor credit.  

Concerns have been raised about the possibility of the government using this system to target and discriminate against individuals or groups based on their political beliefs or other personal characteristics. In the French documentary “Tous surveillés : 7 milliards de suspects”, this system is purportedly implemented with the intention of "promoting communist morality, even in the most remote areas.".   

In the documentary, they interviewed Bextiyar Tursun, a Chinese resident. He said that many technologies have been created over the years, including police cars, which were equipped with machines that could capture conversations from a distance. That's why, every time a police car drove by, he stopped his conversation with his friend. Similarly, to talk about politics, Bextiyar would drive up to 50km outside the city in mountains with friends.  

This proves that the government exploits this mass surveillance to identify and repress individuals who are not sufficiently loyal to the Communist Party, particularly with the omnipresence of hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras. This reality creates a climate of fear and propaganda. The ability to identify individuals easily, whether on social networks or in everyday life, makes it easier to convert certain people, as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated.  

This also implies that if someone is not communist enough, they could possibly be denied access to healthcare, which is deeply worrying. Given a situation where a person is between life and death and requires medical care, should they be condemned to death simply because of their poor credit? Is it possible that the government is seeking to eliminate those with poor credit in favour of a society made up exclusively of "honest citizens"?  

According to the New York Times, "the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns on social medias doubled in the past two years". This highlights the scale of the problem and the need to think critically about the implications of data collection and government surveillance on society.  

## Where Can This Lead Us?
### China
This is currently happening in China, where discrimination against a specific group is already apparent. Although the risk currently concerns a particular group, it could eventually spread to a wider group. Let's imagine that the Chinese government actually exploited this system to propagate its communist ideas. What if they decided to use social media to influence an even wider audience? Western governments are already expressing concern about the Chinese government's ability to access TikTok user data, a concern that has led the United States to ban the application from its soil.  

### Other
A more current example is Israel, which in 2016 launched the "Blue Wolf" technology. This captures images of Palestinians and then matches them with a database held by the Israeli army and intelligence services. Using facial recognition, the Israeli government can identify any individual of Palestinian origin. We are aware of the ongoing genocide in Palestine. Facial recognition could therefore potentially be used as a tool by the government to eliminate all Palestinians identified by surveillance cameras, thereby contributing to the eradication of this community.  

## Conclusion
The widespread use of personal data by governments for surveillance purposes raises major concerns about privacy, individual rights and the potential risks of abuse of power.  
Regulations must be introduced to regulate the way governments collect, store and use personal data. Without appropriate measures, mass surveillance can easily lead to dystopian scenarios where privacy becomes a relic of the past and political manipulation flourishes.

### Recommendations
As individuals, there are a number of things we can do to reduce its potential abuse: 
-	Be aware of the privacy policies of the online platforms we use
-	Favour security options such as two-factor authentication
-	Encourage the introduction of stricter regulations on the collection and use of data by governments
